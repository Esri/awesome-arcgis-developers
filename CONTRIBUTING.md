- Link additions should be added in alphabetical order of the relevant category.
- Should only have one level of nested lists, preferably none.
- Don't add more than one link per line.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- New categories or naming improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Third-party tools/resources that can be combined or complements the ArcGIS Platform are welcome, they just need to have an open source or freemium version.

Keep in mind that this repository is mainly targeted to developers new to [ArcGIS Platform](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/arcgis-platform/) with no geographic information systems background. Because of this, we are not including advance tools like Desktop applications that requires a GIS background.
